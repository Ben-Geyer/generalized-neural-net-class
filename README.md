A small project from the summer of 2018 that I used to learn about how neural networks and back propagation work. By making a generalized implementation, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical functions that make them work. Additionally, I used this project to experiment with implementing different activation functions and optimization methods. 

Please note that, as this project's sole purpose was my own learning, I did not spend time adding comments or refactoring code.
